							<p>Trough&middot;Club will be shutting down.</p>

						<p>
							When we started Trough&middot;Club, we had one simple vision in mind: <b>a world without thirsty horses.</b> Our goals were ambitious and our dream was noble. But, in the end, we weren't able to create enough revenue to keep the water flowing. 
						</p>

							<h3>A look back</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Over 10 million horses die every year due to thirst related illnesses, and even more horses under perform because they feel a bit parched. We set out to change that and end equine thirst.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our idea was to bring timely watering troughs to thirsty horses using the Trough&middot;Club mobile app. With a few taps on a screen, a rider could summon water for their horse. Within minutes a trough of water would be lead to the horse.
						</p>
						<p>
 							To deliver this we built out an amazing full stack platform for water trough delivery. We built custom drones, we sourced a sustainable supply of water, and we partnered with farm stores nation wide to provide troughs. Then we packaged that all behind a easy to use mobile app. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The results we phenomenal: The average wait time was 7 minutes. 7 minutes! We could lead water to a horse faster than Starbucks can remake your botched latte.
						</p>
						<p>
							Riders everywhere praised the ease and convenience of Trough&middot;Club. <b>We were set to change the world.</b>
						</p>
						<h3>What went wrong</h3>
						<p>
							We solved the problem of getting water to horses. But there was a hurdle we didn't expect: The horses wouldn't drink.
						</p>
						<p>
							We got the water there: clean, fresh, delicious water. We put it right in front of a thirsty horse. But, no matter what we did, we couldn't get the horse to drink.
						</p>
						<p>
							Why won't the horses drink the freakin' water?? It's right there! Drink the water, you stupid horse. Come on! For the love of Mr. Ed, you are going to die of thirst, and you won't drink water?? What is wrong with you?
						</p>
						<hr />
						<p>
							<b>Is was a heart wrenching decision to close down.</b> But, in the end, the founding team and our investors were in agreement: There's nothing you can do when the market says, "neigh."
						</p>
						<p>
							The app will cease to work at the beginning of November. Please make arrangements to get your horse to a watering hole.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thanks for the wild ride, <br />
							-- <b>Duke, CEO</b>
